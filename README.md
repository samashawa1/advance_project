## Project Folders
 In our project, we've chosen a layered architecture, consisting of the Model, Controller, and Services components. Here's why it's important:

* Controller:
1. Manages the flow of data and user interaction.
2. Receives input from the user interface and delegates tasks to appropriate services.
3. Organizes the application's behavior and ensures proper communication between different parts of the system.

* Service:
1. Contains reusable business logic and operations.
2. Performs tasks such as data manipulation, validation, and interaction with external systems.
3. Encapsulates complex operations into modular and reusable units, promoting maintainability and scalability.

* Model:
1. Represents the data and business logic of the application.
2. Manages data storage, manipulation, and validation.
3. Defines the structure and behavior of the application's data, ensuring consistency and integrity.
